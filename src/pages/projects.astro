  <p>
    During my studies at
    <a href="https://code.berlin" target="_blank" class="underline"
      >CODE University Of Applied Sciences</a
    >, I have started multiple team projects per semester. Due to the fast pace
    of the projects, I have not been able to maintain them. However, I have
    learned a lot from them and I am proud of the work I have done.<br />
    Here are some examples of the stuff I worked on:
