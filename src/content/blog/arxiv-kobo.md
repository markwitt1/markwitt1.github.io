Reading scientific papers on arxiv.org directly from your Kobo E-Reader without needing a USB connection sounds like a dream, right? This guide will walk you through the process, step-by-step.

## The Challenge with PDFs

Many scientific papers on arxiv.org are in PDF format. Directly saving these PDFs to Pocket means they won't appear on your Kobo E-Reader at all. Thus, to ensure the content is accessible and optimized for reading, we need a different approach.

## Step-by-step Guide:

### 1. Set Up a Pocket Account on Your Kobo E-Reader

_Turn on your Kobo E-Reader._

- Tap the `More` option, usually represented by three dots (`...`).
- Navigate to `Settings`.
- Scroll and find the `Accounts` section.
- Choose `Pocket`, then `Sign in or create an account`.
- Follow the prompts to set up an account. Remember, the Firefox login option won't work here.

### 2. Access Your Pocket Account on a Computer or Mobile Device

- Go to [Pocketâ€™s website](https://getpocket.com/).
- Use the credentials you set up on your Kobo to log in.

### 3. Install the Pocket Browser Extension

- Head to your browser's extensions or add-ons marketplace.
- Search for and install the `Pocket` extension.
- Once installed, you'll gain the ability to add pages to Pocket via the browser's context menu (right-click).

### 4. Make the arxiv PDF Reader-Friendly

- Go to the arxiv page of your desired paper.
- In the URL, change the "x" in "arxiv" to "5".  
  _For example:_  
  Original URL: `https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762`  
  Modified URL: `https://ar5iv.org/abs/1706.03762`
- This change converts the PDF into a responsive webpage, optimized for e-readers.

### 5. Store the Converted Page in Pocket

- Right-click on the page.
- Select the `Save to Pocket` option from the context menu.

### 6. Access and Read the Paper on Your Kobo E-Reader

- On your Kobo E-Reader, from the home screen, tap the `More` tab on the right.
- Tap `My Titles` (next to the Pocket logo. You should now see a list of all articles you've saved, including the recently added paper.
- Tap on the desired paper to read it in a format optimized for the Kobo.
